The course assignments and final story map require collecting and analyzing information about neighborhoods and other urban spaces. In the tutorials, you will be introduced to tools that will allow you to gather, process, and visualize data so that you can complete the assignments and create your own story map. No prior experience or familiarity with quantitative data or GIS/spatial software is assumed in the tutorials. If you have some prior experience, you will likely be able to skim over anything that looks familiar and focus on new techniques. These tutorials are a work in progress. Recommendations for improving the content are welcome. If you run across typos, grammatical errors, or confusing language, please send your comments, questions, and feedback to Francine Stephens at fis@stanford.edu. Each tutorial is a chapter in this website. You can navigate through the chapters using the sidebar. At the top of this page, you will see settings options in the navigation bar. Hover over the icons in the top bar to hide the sidebar or change the font and color scheme to your preference.

The tool is quite intuitive to use and allows you to quickly acquire current and historical census and demographic data. Although Social Explorer allows users to create maps, we will not use the mapping functionality. We will use a different mapping software - ArcGIS Online (AGO) - that is easier to incorporate into the final ArcGIS Story Map that you will create. AGO and Story Maps software will be introduced in the subsequent tutorials. Social Explorer will be particularly helpful for you as you complete Neighborhood Assignment #1 (especially question #5). This tool may also be useful to you when you complete Neighborhood Assignment #5 in Week 5. A basic outline of the steps you will need to take to complete the assignment are as follows: Log-in to Social Explorer via Stanford Libraries &amp; Stanford credentials Navigate to tables Select a dataset Select a geography Select variables Export data This tutorial will walk through each of the steps using San Francisco as an example city. 2.1 Accessing Social Explorer Data Stanford provides students and staff with access to Social Explorer via an institutional license. All that is required to use Social Explorer is your Stanford key and password. Go to the Stanford Libraries homepage and type Social Explorer into the search bar. The first hit under the Catalog panel is the Social Explorer data tool. Click on the external Social Explorer link at the bottom of the top entry, which is outlined in red in the image below. Stanford library login for Social Explorer You will then be prompted to provide your Stanford credentials. After logging in you should see the Social Explorer home page. Navigate over to the Tables tab in the left-hand sidebar. This is outlined in red in the image below. Social Explorer Home Page 2.2 Select a dataset On the Tables page you will find a list of datasets. As you can see, Social Explorer has a lot of datasets available. For the purposes of assignment #1, you will only need to focus on the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates. Select the down arrow on the right-hand side of the ACS 5-year estimates tab to reveal the years of available data. You will want to use the most recent year of available data, which is listed at the top as the 2015-2019 (5 year Estimate). Click on Begin Report for the 2015-2019 5 year Estimates - this is highlighted in yellow in the image below. Access the 2019 ACS from the Data Tables page Background on ACS Data: The American Community Survey is a demographic survey program conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that runs all year, every year. It is the yearly counterpart to the decennial census. ACS data, despite its various limitations, is some of the best data researchers and practitioners typically have to understand who is in our urban areas, and how theyre doing in their year-to-year lives. Understanding how to work with this data is critical, and this tutorial will just scratch the surface of learning about ACS/Census data. 2.3 Select your geography Now you can filter down the data to your area of interest. In the case of Assignment #1, question #5, you will want to filter to the city in which your neighborhood is located.1 The steps and image below walk you through how to fill out the geographic options for filtering the data. To do this, first select Place (160 geographic code) in the first drop down menu. Then, in the second drop-down menu, select the state in which your city is located. Finally, select the city in the list of places. Use the key-command Ctrl-F (Command-F on Mac) and type the city name in the search bar to more quickly find and highlight the city in the list of places. Be sure to click on the city after it has been highlighted in the list. After you have clicked on the city, select the Add button below the list. The city should now be in the list of selected geographies. Once you see it in the selected geographies, then click on Proceed to Tables Filter to your geographic area of interest 2.4 Select your variables Now, we are at one of the more exciting parts of the data extraction process - picking variables! For assignment #1, you will want to pick variables that are comparable to the ones in the FFIEC Geocoding Systems report for the census tracts in your neighborhoods (e.g., total population, median family income, racial demographics, housing characteristics - number of housing units, housing tenure, vacant units, etc.). This will allow you to compare and contrast the characteristics of your neighborhood and the city at large. Leave the first drop-down menu for datasets as-is (i.e., Social Explorer Tables: ACS 2019 5 Year Estimates). The second drop-down menu is where you select the variables (or Tables, in Social Explorer terminology). Like before, click on the variable(s) in the list that you want and then select the Add button below. Make sure all of the variables that you want are in the selected variables list. Once the variables are in the list, select the Show results button. The image below gives you an example of what you should see on this screen. Select variables of interest 2.5 View &amp; Export data All of the important data and variable selections have been made, so you are now ready to view your data and use it in your analysis and write-up. Social Explorer gives you multiple export options. When you clicked Show results, you were taken to the report page, which shows in tabular format the breakdown for each of the variables you had selected. This format should be sufficient for comparing the population and housing statistics for the city to your neighborhood. I would recommend saving the report to Social Explorer in case you want to come back to it at a later time. Click on the Save As button in the top right corner of the page (pictured below), and give your report a title. Save your data as a Social Explorer Report Once you have saved the report, one other nice feature is that you can share it with others via a web-link. If you would like to share, click on the icon next to the Save As button and copy the link. If you would prefer to download the data to save it to a local folder on your computer, you will want to select the Excel tab (outlined in red below). Then, you should select both radio boxes under the General options header, which will give you the data in both percent and counts. Finally, you can select which Excel file format version you would prefer to have the data in (.xlsx or .xls). The file will appear in your downloads file for you to view and use as you see fit. Export data as an Excel file Final Note: That rounds out the steps for downloading data in Social Explorer. In the future, you can follow the same set of steps to get census tract data for other types of geographies like census tracts. The same set of steps also apply to working with any of the other datasets should you choose to explore other datasets in the future. If you have questions about any of the steps laid out here or about how to download other types of data in Social Explorer email Francine Stephens at fis@stanford.edu. In future assignments, you may want to filter to the census tracts that comprise your neighborhood. Instead, of selecting the place geography, you would select census tracts and select the census tract identifiers that belong to your neighborhood. "],["ago.html", "3 Intro to ArcGIS Online 3.1 What is GIS? 3.2 Logging In 3.3 The Interface 3.4 Explore Basemaps 3.5 Find our Class Group", " 3 Intro to ArcGIS Online We are now at a point in the course where we get to start mapping. Hurrah! The goal of this tutorial is to introduce ArcGIS Online (AGO), which we will use for all of the assignments that have a mapping component to them. AGO is a web-based alternative to desktop GIS software, so you will not need to install any software on your personal computer. In this introductory tutorial, we will focus upon the fundamental concepts needed to begin using the AGO interface for exploring and analyzing spatial data. 3.1 What is GIS? GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems. Most people think of GIS as a mapping software because maps are the most familiar way of visualizing spatial relationships. However, GIS is more than maps. The maps are just the geographic containers for information about the physical and social world. At its core, GIS is a series of databases that allow users to create, manipulate, and analyze data that has been geographically referenced to the Earths surface. Think of the database side of GIS as multiple spreadsheets containing rows filled with information about the social or physical world (e.g., demographics, crime incidents, weather patterns) that you can organize and categorize, but then also assign specific spatial locations. Once the data are organized in the database, GIS becomes a visualization tool that allows you to view relationships on a map and analyze with spatial methods. Although the visualization side of GIS is the most important for this class, I bring up the database side because it is relevant for importing data into AGO. In order for AGO to properly plot the data we have collected on a map, we will need to make sure that it is formatted in a manner that the database is familiar with. We will carefully walk through the formatting details in the next few chapters. First, lets cover accessing AGO and the layout of the interface. 3.2 Logging In To log into AGO: Go to https://stanford.maps.arcgis.com and click on the Sign In tab at the top right. Click on the Enterprise Login button. Click on the Stanford University button to launch SSO. Continue logging in using the Stanford SSO log-in and authentication. You will be redirected back to Stanford Geospatial Centers AGO Home page, which is shown below. You should now see your username at the top right corner of the page. AGO Home Page 3.3 The Interface Across the top of the AGO Home page, you will see a Tab Bar with tabs for Home, Gallery, Map, Scene, Groups, Content, and Organization. Below the Tab Bar is a gallery featuring many GIS tutorials and resources created by Stanford Geospatial Center staff. Some of these tutorials are linked to the Resources page of this web-book for you to view at your own leisure. In addition to providing good introductory GIS lessons, these tutorials were created using StoryMaps, so viewing them would provide you with an example of what a StoryMap looks and feels like. If you click on the Map tab on the Tab Bar you will be taken you a New map in the Mapviewer. The Mapviewer is where we will be creating our maps. Go ahead and click on the Map tab, so that we can walk through the functions in the Mapviewer. 3.3.1 Components of the Mapviewer The Mapviewer has four main components, which are indicated with speech bubbles in the image below. Main components of the Mapviewer The Map takes up most real-estate on the page. Currently, it just contains a basemap, but as you start to add data, other features will appear. The AGO Map works like most web-based interactive maps, with zooming and panning done using a mouse, or scroll wheel and arrow keys. You can also click on the plus and minus buttons on the top left corner of the map. To the left of the Map is the Content Pane, which will hold your map layers and show the symbology of the layers as a legend. Layers will populate in this pane once we start to add data. Above the Content Pane and Map, shaded in gray are the Toolbar and Search functions. The Toolbar contains the functions you will need to import data layers, style your map, and analyze spatial data. These functions are summarized below from the left to the right side of the t. 3.3.2 The Toolbar Details&gt;Content - Clicking on Details hides or shows the Content pane. The Content pane holds the layers you add to your Map. You can interact with those layers by hovering over the layer name to see the tools available. Add - This button gives you multiple options for importing layers of data to your map. You can import from your computer, the web, or from existing AGO content. We will demonstrate these different import options in subsequent chapters. Basemap - The Basemap option offers a number of global basemap options, including imagery, topography, oceans, and other styled basemaps. Analysis - The Analysis button provides you with multiple geoprocessing tools to analyze your data, including overlay, proximity, network and summary analysis. Some of these tools will be introduced in subsequent chapters. Save - This button allows you to save a new map to your content and save any updates you make to your map. Share - Here, you will find several options for sharing your maps with others. Print - This option creates a printable html version of your map. Use your browsers print dialog for printing. Directions - This option is provides walking and driving times, distances and directions. Measure - Measure distances and areas of features on your map. Bookmarks - Here, you can save locations in your map. These bookmarks are not going to be particularly useful for your web-map, but may be useful when we start working on the StoryMap. Search - You can type the name of a location or a physical street address in the search bar and the map will zoom to the location. 3.4 Explore Basemaps Lets start getting acclimated to AGO by changing the basemap. ArcGIS Online provides multiple basemap options. The basemap provides geographic context for the data layers that you will bring into AGO. Start by zooming into an area of interest. In the GIF below, you will see that I typed San Francisco in the Search bar and zoomed into the city. Then, click on the Basemap button at on the Toolbar. You will see a list of basemap options appear. Select one of the provided basemap layers and watch the new basemap appear on your map. You should also notice that the Contents pane has updated. It should now show the name of the new basemap you selected as a layer. Change the basemap Change the basemap a few times to explore the available basemaps. Then, click on the New Map Tab at the top of the page, to switch to a new map view. The New Map Tab generates a new map frame and basemap for you to start making a new map document. 3.5 Find our Class Group Our class has a group page on AGO. The group is called The Social Life of Neighborhoods. We will use the group page as a repository for data layers that Francine will curate for you. For example, your census tract neighborhood boundaries will be stored here. If your city does not provide crime data that in an exportable format, Francine will scrape the police departments crime web map and store the scraped map layer on the group page for you to add to your map. The next few chapters will review how to access the data layers from our group page. Before you proceed to the next chapter and the Assignment #3 mapping exercise, you need to make sure that you have access to the group page. If you had used AGO in the past, your account was located and added to the group. If you are logging into AGO for the first time, you can find the group and request access to join. The GIF below shows how you can navigate to the Groups Tab on the Tab bar from the Home page. Be sure to select My Organizations Groups on the Groups landing page. In the Search Bar type in the group name, and select it from the list. You should then see an option for requesting membership. Francine will add you after you put in your request. Find the Social Life of Neighborhoods Group Once you have access to the group, continue on to the next chapter to learn how to add new data layers to the basemap. "],["geocoding.html", "4 Geocoding 4.1 What is Geocoding 4.2 Preparing Data for Geocoding 4.3 Geocoding in AGO 4.4 Changing the Symbology 4.5 Plotting Neighborhood Boundaries 4.6 Exporting your map as a PDF", " 4 Geocoding At this point, you should be familiar with the ArcGIS Online Mapping interface. You are now ready to start adding data layers of your own to a basemap. Neighborhood Assignment #3 asks you to create a map of the most important/influential/powerful/interesting non-profit organizations in or near your neighborhood. To do this, we will need to two sources of data - the locations of the non-profits and the neighborhood boundaries. The non-profit locations and neighborhood boundaries will be two separate data layers on your map. We will need to create the non-profit locations data through a process called geocoding. The census tract boundaries of your neighborhood have been provided to you as a layer in our class AGO group. In the sections below, we will walk through geocoding the non-profit locations and accessing the neighborhood boundaries through our groups shared content. 4.1 What is Geocoding Geocoding is the process of transforming a street address to a location on the Earths surface, so that it can be displayed as a point on a map. You can import one street address at a time to geocode or provide multiple addresses at once in a table. Under the GIS hood, the database side of GIS looks up the street address in a street segments data layer and finds the pair of latitude and longitude coordinates that correspond with that street address. Those coordinates are attached as attributes to the street address you provided and plotted as geographic features on the map. The resulting layer of geocoded points can be stylized on a map and analyzed with geoprocessing tools. 4.2 Preparing Data for Geocoding Assignment #3 requires that you have at least 10 non-profits on your map, so we will go ahead and batch geocode all 10 locations at once by recording the addresses in a table. Be sure to follow the GuideStar non-profit look-up tutorial on Canvas to identify your 10 important non-profits. Once you have identified the 10 important non-profits be sure that they have physical street address and not PO box addresses. The geocoder will not recognize PO box mailing addresses. The screenshot below demonstrates an appropriate way of formatting your non-profit data for the geocoder. Format the address data Open up a spreadsheet software of your choice. Then, create a header row at the top of your spreadsheet that has cells for the name of the organization, the Address, City, State, Zipcode, and type of service the organization provides. You do not need to bold the text. I did that just to illustrate that this is a header row that AGO will interpret as the attributes of your data. If you use the same header names for the address components that I have, the AGO geocoder will auto-detect the fields correctly. This will eliminate a couple of mouse-clicks from your workflow. Each row will represent a non-profit that you have selected. Enter the name of the organization. Then, parse out the components of the address, starting with the street address, then the city name, the state abbreviation, and the five digit zipcode. The last column holds a description of the type of service the organization provides. It is okay to use common street type abbreviations in the street name (e.g., St for Street, Ave for Avenue) because the geocoder will recognize them. The service type column is not necessary for geocoding, but it will be helpful when we style the symbology in our map. Symbology is the cartographic term for the icon or shading you use in your map to represent attributes of your data. Once you have entered the address information for your non-profits, save the spreadsheet as a CSV. You are now ready to bring the table of addresses into AGO for geocoding. 4.3 Geocoding in AGO Open up Mapviewer and start with just the basemap. Feel free to change the basemap if you would like. You can also zoom into your neighborhood using any of the Zoom/Pan options or use the Search Bar, which is what I did. When you are ready to upload the non-profit locations, navigate to the Add Button on the Toolbar and follow the steps in the GIF below. Geocoding Select Add layer from File. Find and select the CSV file that you saved with the addresses. Import the layer. You will see an Add CSV Layer dialogue box. Fill out the options as follows: For Locate features by, select the Address or Places radio button. Be sure you are using the ArcGIS World Geocoding Service. For the In option, use the drop down box and find the United States. Finally, review the Field Name from your table and Location Name columns in the table. Make sure that they match up. If you named the columns as I did above, then they should automatically populate as they should. That is, Name should be Not Used; Address should be Address or Place; City should be City; State should be State; and Zip should be Postal. Service is not used. When you are sure that the Table Field Names and Location Field Names match up, select Add Layer. Now you should see the non-profits plotted as points on the map. 4.4 Changing the Symbology Dont leave the non-profit locations as colored dots. Instead, lets style the locations with symbols that reflect the type of service the non-profit provides. This is shown in the GIF above (My apologies for not separating this part in the recording). In part 1, select the field labeled Service in the drop-down menu. Then select the Options button on Types in Part 2. You should see all of the labels for Serve appear next to the colored dots. Click on a colored dot icon, and you should see a dialogue box with other symbol options. Stay in the shape symbol type, and use the drop-down menu to find symbols that would represent the services provided by the non-profits in your neighborhood. When you find an icon you like, you might also want to change the symbol size before you move on to the next symbol. When you are happy with all of your symbols, select Okay and then Done. You should see the Contents pane contains the non-profits data layer. If you click on the Show Legend button underneath the layer name (highlighted in the image below), the icons and labels will appear. Also, if you click on any of the icons on the map, you will see a pop-up emerge for that location. All of the information in your table is contained in the pop-up. These pop-ups will be more relevant later on when we build our story maps. Now, if you are happy with your non-profits, you can now move on to the neighborhood boundaries. Non-profit locations symbology and popups 4.5 Plotting Neighborhood Boundaries The neighborhood boundaries are saved in our class group page - The Social Life of Neighborhoods. We will use the Add Button again to add the layer from our group page. The GIF below shows the steps, which are also written out below. Importing neighborhood boundaries Select Search for Layers. Layers in My Content will be shown first, but you should find the drop-down options and select My Groups. Scroll through the Groups layers to find your neighborhood. Click on the Plus button on the bottom right corner of your neighborhood layer. You can close out the search for layers panel when you see the neighborhood polygon populate on your map and in the Contents pane. The neighborhood is a colored polygon when imported onto the map. We should change the symbology to just show the boundaries and not color the full area of the neighborhood. Click on the Neighborhood layer in the Contents pane, and navigate to the button with three shapes. This is the change style button. Keep the show location only option selected in part 1. In part 2, select Options. Then, click on the symbol to change the symbology. The Fill style will come up first. Select no color option to remove color from the neighborhood area. This will leave the inside of the polygon transparent. Then, select the Outline option and pick a color to outline the neighborhood boundaries. You might also consider changing the heaviness of the line by increasing the line width. When you are happy with the style, select Okay and then Done, to get back to the map and contents pane. Lastly, clean up the name of the layer in the Contents pane. On the layer, click the three horizontal dots button on the layer, which prompts a drop-down list of options. Select rename and change the name. NOTE: The neighborhood boundary files have been named based on this syntax: nhood_name_cityname. If you listed multiple names for your neighborhood, the first name may only be listed in the filename for brevity. The city name may be abbreviated in some instances. If you have trouble finding your neighborhood based with this naming system, open up a new tab in your browser and go to the group page content. The content has been organized, so you can filter to the files that have been categorized as neighborhood boundaries. Scroll through the neighborhood boundaries. You should be able to see the outlines and find the one that looks like your neighborhood. 4.6 Exporting your map as a PDF If you click on the Legend button in the Content pane, you will see both layers and the detailed symbology. When you are happy with the look of your map, save the map by going to Save button (the disk) on the Toolbar. You will need to select the Save As option because it is the first time you are saving the map. Give the Map an informative title and a few tags when you are saving it. Saving your map The map is saved to your Content page in AGO. For this assignment, you will also want to export the map as a PDF. This is also a multi-step process that converts your webmap to a web-app and then to a PDF file (I know that seems like a lot of work). The GIF below will walk you through it along with the steps that are written out below. Transform webmap to a web-app Navigate to the Share button (the chain-link icon) on the toolbar. You can ignore the content at the top of the dialogue box. Find and click on the Create a Webb App button toward the bottom of the page. You will be redirected to a new dialgoue box to Create a New Web App. Select the middle tab that says WebAppBuilder. Again, you are redirected to a new dialogue box, but the information in it should look familiar. The boxes should contain the information you included when you saved your webmap. Make sure that the radio box next to the sentence: Share this app in the same way as the map (The Social Life of Neighborhoods) is checked. Then, scroll to the bottom of the page and click get started. Navigate over to the Widget controller on the WebApp Interface. Scroll down the left hand panel to the empty widget place-holders. Click on one of the empty ones. You will be redirected to an array of widgets. Find and select the Print widget. Be sure to select a print option other than Map_Only and to have the Show Legend option selected. Next, add the legend widget to one of the other empty widget containers. Print the webapp as a PDF Select the Print widget icon on the map. Title the map (again). Then select a layout option other than Map_Only. Keep the layout as PDF, and then select print. When the PDF icon shows up on the print panel, select it so that it will open. You can save the PDF and submit it along with your write-up. Your PDF map should look something like this. Make sure that all of the layers are showing up. PDF version of map Dont worry about the strange legend layout in the PDF or if the layout did not zoom in on the extent of your neighborhood as much as the web-map did. The webmap is saved and is what will ultimately be part of your StoryMap. You have now completed your first web-map! Way to go! In the next assignment, youll build on these skills with a larger dataset that contains incidents of crime in the city where your neighborhood is located.
