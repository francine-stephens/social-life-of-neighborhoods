# Mapping Segregation

With Assignment #5, we are once again we are interested in tracking spatial patterns and distributions in and around our neighborhood. Instead of focusing on events/incidents like crime and public order like we did last week, we are now interested in how people of different racial/ethnic backgrounds are distributed across our chosen neighborhood and in the city and region that encompass our neighborhood. 

The assignment asks you to think about the prevalence and consistency of segregation in and around your neighborhood. To be able to make claims about the segregation, we will need to create a couple of maps and graphs. These visuals will help us understand which racial groups have resided in the neighborhood, the city, and the region, and how the distribution of the racial groups in the neighborhood compares to the distribution in the city and to the distribution across places within the region. On top of that, we are going to enable time functionality on our maps and graphs, so that we can track change over time in the composition and distribution of racial groups in the three different geographies. You're probably noticing that in the process of mapping segregation, we are dealing with multiple dimensions. The dimensions that we want to pay careful attention to are:

1. Racial groups - Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, Asian, Native, Hispanic, Nonwhite (aggregate of all non-white groups)
2. Geographic units - Neighborhood, City/Place, Region
3. Time - Each decade from 1970 to 2020. Some of you may find that the first decade in your data is 1980. This is because data were not collected for your city at the census tract level. 

That may seem like a lot of dimensions to consider, but you will find that there are visual techniques in GIS, especially web-based GIS, that make expressing all of these dimensions in a map straightforward and digestible. In the following sections, we will walk through three mapping styles that are useful for understanding segregation: dot density, predominance, and choropleth mapping. The data you need to make your maps is provided on our AGO class group page. Each section will direct you to the appropriate data layers. 


## Racial Composition

Before we get to point of quantifying racial residential segregation in and around our neighborhood, we need to be able to see the racial composition of our neighborhood and other neighborhoods in the city in which it is located. A map of racial composition will tell us which racial groups are present and how much of the overall population each group represents. In your readings for the week, the Massey & Denton and Schafran provided a sense of racial composition when they pointed to tables with the breakdown of race by percentages and in maps that were shaded by the percent of a single race group, e.g., % African American population. In the next few sections, we are going to go a step further with some mapping techniques that can show multiple racial groups at once and which racial groups are predominant in the neighborhood population.


### Predominance Map

Let's start with a predominance map. The sub-units (smaller geography) that we will map are census tracts and our super-unit (larger geography) is the city. The predominance map will show two attributes for each census tract in the city: 

1) The most common racial group in the census tract,
2) How predominant the most common group is (i.e., the clear majority or just barely the majority). 

Start by opening up a new map in the Map Viewer. Navigate to the **Add Layers** button and search within our group page for the layer of census tracts in your neighborhood's city [Naming Style: CITY_NAME_Tracts_Race]. Add the layer to the map. You should see a time slider at the bottom of your Map viewer now like the one shown in the image below. If you do not see the time slider, email [Francine](mailto:fis@stanford.edu) so she can fix the configuration of your layer. 


![Add the time-series census tract layer](images\add_census_tracts.png)

** Style the Predominance Layer**

![Add the time-series census tract layer](images\style_predominance_census_tracts.gif)

1. Once you have added the layer to the map, go into the layer and **Change the Style**. You will need to specify the racial groups as attributes. The GIF above shows how to add each group successively.   
2. Select **Predominant Category** as the drawing style, and click on the options.
3. In the options, change the label names from the abbreviated variable names to the actual racial group names. 
    i. Select a color scheme that you would like. You can manually select colors or pick a palette that you would prefer.
    ii. Do not change the transparency settings.  
4. Select Okay and Done and view the predominant racial groups in each of the census tracts in your city. 

Notice in the legend that the strength of predominance is represented based on the intensity of the color shading. Darker colors indicate more predominance, while lighter/more transparent coloring represents more of a plurality of groups being present in the tract. However, right now this visual is deceptive because each decade is stacked on one another in this layer. We need to turn on the time-slider to see the predominant groups in each decade. 

**Adjust the time intervals**

To set the time slider intervals to show decade-steps, navigate to the **Configure button** on the time slider. It is the button all the way to the right of the slider. 

![Adjust the time slider to show all decades](images\adjust_time_slider_predominance.gif)

1. Select advanced options.
2. Change the interval to **Decade** and the step is **1**
3. You can adjust the play-back speed by moving the slider at the top.


Before you watch your animated map, I recommend making a couple of aesthetic decisions: 

1. Add the layer with your neighborhood boundaries, **style it so that the polygon area is transparent and you only have an outline of the neighborhood boundaries.** This will draw attention to your neighborhood. 
2. Because the series of maps we will be making are thematic maps with lots of colors, it is a good idea to opt for a basemap with a neutral background style and minimal colors, labels, and features. I would recommend changing the background style to the **Light or Dark Gray Canvas**. 

When you are happy with your basemap, hit play on the time slider and watch where the predominant groups change and stay the same. Note what is happening within the census tracts in and around your neighborhood. Save your map with the **Save As** button. Be sure to give it an informative title.

![Watch your animated racial group predominance map](images\predominance_animated.gif)


This map gives us a good sense of the predominant groups, but does not show all groups residing in the census tract at once. For this, we need to turn to the quintessential composition map - the dot density map! 


### Dot Density Map

The Map Viewer we have been using up to this point does not have the ability to render a dot density map. However, the new Map Viewer does, so we are going to switch into its interface for the dot density map. With your predominance map open in the (classic) Map Viewer, navigate to the button in the top bar that says: **Open in new Map Viewer**. 


![Open the map in the New Map Viewer](images\open_new_map_viewer.png)


Follow the steps in the GIF and written below to style the dot density map:

![Style your dot density map](images\dot_density_drawing_style.gif)


1. Navigate over to the **Layers Pane** and click on the **three dots on the census tract layer with your racial groups.**
2. Select **Show Properties**. The properties pane will appear on the right-hand side of your screen for you to change the drawing style. 
3. Select **Edit layer style** to change the drawing style. 
4. Then, select **Dot Density** from the Drawing Styles.
5. Select the **Style Options** to change some of the properties. Set style options similar to the way you did in the Predominance map.
    i. Rename the race group categories with their real names instead of the abbreviated variable names. 
    ii. Change the color scheme. I replicated the color scheme of the predominance map. 
    iii. Test out different dot value representations. I found bumping down the value to work better and capture density in more dense neighborhoods. However, the ideal value is going to vary based on how urbanized/dense your city is, so test out different sizes. 
    
Go ahead and play the time animation and watch what happens. 

![Animated dot density map](images\animate_dot_density_map.gif)

Zoom and pan around your map. Notice that the dots move and re-size. The dots are not representing specific locations of residents within the tract; they are randomly distributed across the tract. The resizing changes as you zoom in and out. To change that, go into the layer options and turn off the rescaling option. You may have to try several different drawing sizes before you find one that works best for your neighborhood/city. 


If you have multiple tracts in your neighborhood, it might be worth filtering down to the extent of your neighborhood as I have done in the image below. Go to the filter tab on the side bar and filter based on the tract GEOIDs in your neighborhood. You can find your tract GEOIDs by clicking on the tracts and viewing the pop-up information.

![Filter down dot density map down to your neighborhood](images\filter_dot_density_nhood.png)


**Before you close your map be sure to save your map with a new name.** 

For your assignment, you do not need to present both the predominance map and the dot-density map. Pick the visual that helps to convey your message. If presenting all groups or the denseness/sparseness of the population is important, then the dot density map would be ideal. If you are more focused on closely tracking one or two groups in the neighborhood/city, then the predominance map would probably be effective. You cannot save a time series map as a PDF, so you will need to Share the link to the web-map with us. **If you create the dot density map, set the share settings to the AGO class group. We will access the map from the group when grading.** 



## Visualizing Segregation Indices

Now, that we have mapped racial composition, we will want to quantify the level of segregation between neighborhoods within the city and examine how the level of segregation has changed over time. Some measures of segregation are more clearly visualized in a graph rather than a map. This is the case for the dissimilarity index. Other segregation measures like the divergence index can be clearly captured in a choropleth map. We will walk through what each index means and how to visualize it. 


### Dissimilarity Index Graph

The dissimilarity index is the most commonly used measure of segregation. It is the simplest to calculate and interpret. The dissimilarity index indicates how unevenly two racial groups are distributed across tracts within a city. The dissimilarity score can be interpreted as the percent of one racial group (in the pair being considered) that would need to move to other neighborhoods in order to have an even distribution of the two racial groups across the city. 

We can use a spreadsheet software like Excel or Google sheets to view and chart the dissimilarity index over time for neighborhoods in the city. If you know how to make graphs using a statistical software like R, Stata, SPSS, or Python, you are welcome to use that, but I am going to walk through how to do this in Excel. 

1. Download the CSV of the dissimilarity scores from the AGO class group page. You can find the **datafile for your city** stored under the **Segregation Data** category. 
2. 


At this point, you might notice that there are a couple of constraints of the dissimilarity index. First, we can only consider segregation between two racial groups at a time. Second, the dissimilarity score is produced for the super-unit (the city) and we cannot decompose the dissimilarity index to show how much each tract contributes to the dissimilarity score of the city. Let's turn to a measure that allows us to get around those two limitations - the divergence index. 


### Divergence Index Choropleth Map 

With the divergence index, we are representing the departure of the tract's racial make-up to the super-unit of interest, which in this case is the city. Although this measure takes into account all of the racial groups present in a census tract and the city at the same time, there is not a particularly straightforward way of interpreting the divergence index score. Unlike the dissimilarity index, the score does not represent the share of people from one racial group that would need to be redistributed across the city/larger sub-unit. Instead, the divergence score is generally interpreted based on which categorical level the score falls into: 

1. High Segregation >= 0.25,
2. Moderate Segregation >= 0.1 & <0.25,
3. Low Segregation < 0.1

In the steps below, we will first walk through mapping the raw divergence index scores in a choropleth map. Then, we will  reclassify the choropleth map into the three levels of segregation categories presented above.

In a new map viewer window, navigate to the **Add Layer** button and find the layer of census tracts in your city with the divergence index scores [Naming style: "San_Francisco_tracts_divergence"]. Once you have added the layer, check that time is enabled and set the interval to decades in the configure options. Let's now build the choropleth map by navigating to the **Change style** button on the layer.

1. In the change style page, set the attribute to **divergence** in the drop-down menu. 
2. Select the **color** drawing style, and go into the **options.**
3. 

Push play on the time slider and notice how the shading of the tracts in and around your neighborhood changes over time. Darkening of colors over time indicates that the tract's population is becoming increasingly segregated. Tracts that trend toward lighter shades over time are experiencing decreases in segregation.

With an index measure like the divergence index, sometimes the changes in the score over time are not clearly visualized using a choropleth map with the full numeric scale. It can be easier to view tracts experiencing changes in segregation levels by reclassifying them into categories, like the ones listed above for segregation levels. Return to the **Change Styles** page for the layer and again select the **Options** button on the color drawing style. 

1. Check the **Reclassify data** radio button. 
2. 


Now, when you play the time animated map, this reclassified, categories spotlight the tracts that experience substantial changes in segregation levels. 

## Segregation between Places

Now, let's turn to a larger scale - the region. The Schafran chapter made an argument about segregation becoming more prominent *between places across a region* instead of just *between neighborhoods in the same city* over time. To get a sense of segregation between places in a region, we need to change our units. In our maps and graphs, our sub-unit needs to change from census tracts/neighborhoods to places - cities, suburbs, and exurbs - in a region. The super-unit is now the region, instead of the city.

The approach we are taking in measuring and visualizing regional segregation parallels Schafran's, but there are a few departures that we are going to take that are worth mentioning briefly here. 

**Places**

Schafran uses **places as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau.** Census places are a good approximation of cities and suburbs, but this geographic unit does not actually cover all of the land area, and consequently people, in a county/region. View the maps of the 50/500 club in the assigned chapter to see this. The Census Bureau lets states' OMB identify what constitutes a "place", so there is actually a lot of variation across the U.S. in terms of what gets designated as a place or not. Some states specify a certain population threshold, and others, like Hawaii, make sure that they draw boundaries in such a way that accounts for the entirety of the land area/population. 

Why does this shortcoming of Census places matter for racial residential segregation? Some of the areas that are not *emplaced* by the Census are these exurban places that are experiencing population and housing growth in the last decade. This is especially true in the South and American sunbelt region. At this point, there is not much research on these types of areas, so we do not really know if these exurban areas are becoming home to homogeneous or racially diverse populations. In the attribute table of your places map layer, you will see both the census designated places, which have names that end in city, town, or CDP as well as the non-emplaced areas, which have been labeled an unincorporated place in the county in which they are located (e.g., San Mateo County unincorporated place).


**Region**

Schafran also takes issue with using the Census Bureau's Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as a region. The geographic extent of MSAs varies across the U.S. because they are drawn according to population size thresholds. Schafran thinks that commuting patterns are an important dimension of a region, which is what he uses to define the 9 counties that make-up the Bay Area region. It is tricky to apply his approach to defining a region to other parts of the country, so regions are going to be defined differently based on where your neighborhood is located. If your neighborhood is in the Bay Area, your region extent will be the same as Schafran's. If your neighborhood is located somewhere else, check-out the table below to see how it has been defined. 

**[Insert table about here]**


### Racial Composition Map

Now that you are familiar with these larger units, navigate to the **Add layers** button and search for the places layer in your region that has racial composition data [Naming style: "Bay_Area_Region_places_race"]. Add the places layer and change your basemap to the same minimalist style one that you used when you mapped racial composition of your neighborhood and the tracts in the city. 

At this point, you will want to apply the mapping techniques covered above on mapping [racial composition][Racial Composition] to this new layer of places in the region. Do not forget to **configure the time settings** to the one decade intervals. 

There is a lot of variation across the class in terms of the size of the region and number of places, so a dot density map may not be the most effective approach for all students. Regardless of the type of map you choose for racial composition in your region, be sure to pay attention to the racial composition in your city and how it compares to other places - cities, suburbs, and exurbs - in your region across time. Consider how the composition changes you are seeing across places compare to the changes you saw in racial composition of neighborhoods in your city.

When you are happy with your map, **Save it as a new map with an informative title.** Don't forget to set the sharing options to our class group before you move onto mapping segregation in the region.

### Segregation Maps

Finally, we will visualize the segregation measures for the places in our region. At this scale, we can map all of our segregation measures. No graphing is necessary here. Open up a new Map Viewer window and set-up your basemap with the style you prefer.

Then, navigate to the **Add Layers** button and search for the places layers in your region with segregation data [Naming style: "Bay_Area_Region_places_segregation"]. Add the layer to the map. The layer contains the dissimilarity index scores and divergence index scores for all places in the region at each decade. When you interpret the index scores, remember that your **sub-unit is the place** and the **super-unit is the region**.

You can visualize both types of indices using the same choropleth mapping technique demonstrated in the section above where we [mapped the Divergence index][Divergence Index Choropleth Map]. However, **be mindful of the fact that you cannot represent the dissimilarity index for all race pairs (e.g., Black-white, Asian-white, Hispanic-white, etc.) at the same time on a single map.** At this point in the assignment, you may have a sense of which racial/ethnic group pairs that you are particularly focused on. If that is the case and you want to use the dissimilarity index, you can proceed to mapping the set of relevant dissimilarity indices for your analysis. On the other hand, if you have not been focused on certain pairs of racial/ethnic groups, then you have two options. One would be to opt for the divergence index so that you are considering all racial groups at once. The other option is to really explore each of the dissimilarity indices in your maps and see if any patterns jump out. Again, juxtapose the dissimilarity indices of places in the region with your city, and see how they compare over time. 


In the end, we do not need to see every single dissimilarity index and the divergence index mapped in your write-up. Just feature the racial composition and segregation maps that allow you to tease out some spatio-temporal patterns and engage with the theories of segregation you read about this past week. 


**Final Note:** In just a few assignments, you have acquired several mapping techniques in your tool-kit. Take a minute to appreciate how quickly you have picked up on web-mapping and visualizing spatial data. The plus-side of picking up all of these mapping techniques in just a few weeks time is that when we return to mapping in two weeks for Assignment #7, we will end up re-using a lot of these techniques to map gentrification in the neighborhood and across the city. If you have made it this far in the mapping exercises, it should be smooth sailing from here on out.
