The course assignments and final story map require collecting and analyzing information about neighborhoods and other urban spaces. In the tutorials, you will be introduced to tools that will allow you to gather, process, and visualize data so that you can complete the assignments and create your own story map. No prior experience or familiarity with quantitative data or GIS/spatial software is assumed in the tutorials. If you have some prior experience, you will likely be able to skim over anything that looks familiar and focus on new techniques. These tutorials are a work in progress. Recommendations for improving the content are welcome. If you run across typos, grammatical errors, or confusing language, please send your comments, questions, and feedback to Francine Stephens at fis@stanford.edu. Each tutorial is a chapter in this website. You can navigate through the chapters using the sidebar. At the top of this page, you will see settings options in the navigation bar. Hover over the icons in the top bar to hide the sidebar or change the font and color scheme to your preference.

The tool is quite intuitive to use and allows you to quickly acquire current and historical census and demographic data. Although Social Explorer allows users to create maps, we will not use the mapping functionality. We will use a different mapping software - ArcGIS Online (AGO) - that is easier to incorporate into the final ArcGIS Story Map that you will create. AGO and Story Maps software will be introduced in the subsequent tutorials. Social Explorer will be particularly helpful for you as you complete Neighborhood Assignment #1 (especially question #5). This tool may also be useful to you when you complete Neighborhood Assignment #5 in week 5. A basic outline of the steps you will need to take to complete the assignment are as follows: Log-in to Social Explorer via Stanford Libraries &amp; Stanford credentials Navigate to data tables Select a dataset Select a geography Select variables Export data This tutorial will walk through each of the steps using an example city and census tracts. 2.1 Accessing Social Explorer Stanford provides students and staff with access to Social Explorer via an institutional license. All that is required to use Social Explorer is your Stanford key and password. Go to the Stanford Libraries homepage and type Social Explorer into the search bar. Try this. The first hit under the Catalog panel is the Social Explorer data tool. Click on the external Social Explorer link at the bottom of the top entry, which is outlined in red in the image below. Stanford library login for Social Explorer You will then be prompted to provide your Stanford credentials. After logging in you should see the Social Explorer home page pictured below. Social Explorer Home Page 2.2 Navigate to Data Tables 2.3 Select your dataset 2.4 Select your geography 2.5 Select your variables 2.6 Export data Census data, despite its various limitations, is some of the best data researchers and practitioners typically have to understand whos in our urban areas, and how theyre doing in their year-to-year lives. Understanding how to work with this data is critical and deserves a whole chapter in this curriculum.
