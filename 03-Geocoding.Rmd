# Geocoding


At this point, you should be familiar with the ArcGIS Online Mapping interface. You are now ready to start adding data layers of your own to a basemap. Neighborhood Assignment #3 asks you to create a map of the most important/influential/powerful/interesting non-profit organizations in or near your neighborhood. To do this, we will need to two sources of data - the locations of the non-profits and the neighborhood boundaries. The non-profit locations and neighborhood boundaries will be two separate data layers on your map. We will need to create the non-profit locations data through a process called geocoding. The census tract boundaries of your neighborhood have been provided to you as a layer in our class AGO group. In the sections below, we will walk through geocoding the non-profit locations and accessing the neighborhood boundaries through our group's shared content. 


## What is Geocoding

Geocoding is the process of transforming a street address to a location on the Earth's surface, so that it can be displayed as a point on a map. You can import one street address at a time to geocode or provide multiple addresses at once in a table. Under the GIS hood, the "database side" of GIS looks up the street address in a street segments data layer and finds the pair of latitude and longitude coordinates that correspond with that street address. Those coordinates are attached as attributes to the street address you provided and plotted as geographic features on the map. The resulting layer of geocoded points can be stylized on a map and analyzed with geoprocessing tools. 


## Preparing Data for Geocoding

Assignment #3 requires that you have at least 10 non-profits on your map, so we will go ahead and batch geocode all 10 locations at once by recording the addresses in a table. Be sure to follow the GuideStar non-profit look-up tutorial on Canvas to identify your 10 important non-profits. Once you have identified the 10 important non-profits be sure that they have physical street address and **not PO box addresses.** The geocoder will not recognize PO box mailing addresses. 

The screenshot below demonstrates an appropriate way of formatting your non-profit data for the geocoder.

1. Open up a spreadsheet software of your choice. 
2. Then, create a header row at the top of your spreadsheet that has cells for the name of the organization, the Address, City, State, Zipcode, and type of service the organization provides. 
    i. **You do not need to bold the text.** I did that just to illustrate that this is a header row that AGO will interpret as the attributes of your data.
    ii. If you use the same header names for the address components that I have, the AGO geocoder will auto-detect the fields correctly. This will eliminate a couple of mouse-clicks from your workflow.  
3. Each row will represent a non-profit that you have selected. Enter the name of the organization. Then, parse out the components of the address, starting with the street address, then the city name, the state abbreviation, and the five digit zipcode. The last column holds a description of the type of service the organization provides.
    i. It is okay to use common street type abbreviations in the street name (e.g., St for Street, Ave for Avenue) because the geocoder will recognize them. 
    ii. The service type column is not necessary for geocoding, but it will be helpful when we style the symbology in our map. Symbology is the cartographic term for the icon or shading you use in your map to represent attributes of your data. 
4. Once you have entered the address information for your non-profits, save the spreadsheet as a **CSV.**

You are now ready to bring the table of addresses into AGO for geocoding.
