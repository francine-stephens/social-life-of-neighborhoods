# ESRI Story Maps

Tutorial will be *fully* published at the start of week 8. 

Now, it is time to put together a digital visual story of your neighborhood using some of the content you have created throughout the course assignments. We will be making a *story map* about the social life of your neighborhood. The assignment instructions posted on Canvas detail the expectations for the content in your story map. This tutorial provides a little bit of background on ESRI's Story Map platform and points you to the templates and resources that you will use to compile your maps, text, and other types of media into a digital narrative. 

## Creating Story Maps

**What is a story map?** 

ESRI Story Maps are web applications that let you, the author, combine web-maps with narrative text, images, and multimedia, including video and audio. The applications are designed to be attractive and usable by anyone, which makes them great for education and outreach to the general public or to a particular audience. Story maps can be made for many different topics. Basically, anything that you can show on a map can be the topic of a story map!  


There are two versions of Story Maps available online - the classic and new version. We are going to use the **Classic** version. The classic version's biggest asset is that it has a set of templates that are made-to-fill-in. The templates make it easier on you as an author to figure out how to add content to your story. Unfortunately, Stanford's AGO landing page does not directly link to the Classic version of ESRI Story Maps. Instead, you can navigate to the Classic Story Maps splash page from [here](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/). Feel free to add this link to your bookmarks. **Before navigating to the Classic Story Maps splash page, be sure that you are logged into your AGO account.** Classic Story Maps still verifies that you are part of Stanford's institutional AGO account.

**What are the template options?**

ESRI's Story Maps application offers six different templates. Each template lets you deliver a specific viewing experience to your audience. Below is a list of the available templates and a brief summary of the viewing experience they offer. Click on the template name in the list to be redirected to the template's home page, which includes a more detailed description, examples, and a tutorial for using the template.

* [Tour](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-tour/) - A **sequence of place-enabled photos or videos** that are linked to an interactive map that your audience can sequentially take a tour through.
* [Shortlist](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/shortlist/) - Present **a large number of places/points of interest organized into tabs based on themes**. Your audience can interact with the places as they navigate around the map.
* [Journal](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-journal/) - A **scrolling multimedia narrative organized into side-by-side sections on each page**. Text and images can be displayed in a static side-panel alongside your "main stage content" or on top of your "main stage" content in a floating side-panel.
* [Cascade](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/cascade/) - A **scrolling multimedia narrative that fills the page**. Similar to the journal template, but instead allows you to put other multimedia content, like images and text, in immersive sections that fill the entire page.
* [Series](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-series/) - **Present a series of related maps** that your audience can easily browse and switch between using tabs, bullets, or an *expandable* side-panel. The side-panel allows you to embed text and other types of media alongside your maps.
* [Swipe & Spyglass](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/swipe-spyglass/) - **Compare two maps** by swiping back and forth, or by peering through one map to see another.  


It is possible to use multiple story map templates in your story. For example, you may find that the swipe/spyglass would be good for one capturing one key issue in your neighborhood and the tour template would be ideal for another key course theme that is salient in your neighborhood. There are a few different ways of combining and embedding multiple ESRI story map templates. Selecting the best method to combine or embed is going to depend on the templates you are using and the viewing experience you intend to create for the audience. You are not required to use multiple templates, but if you feel like your story would benefit from the features of multiple templates, meet with Francine during her office hours or [book an appointment](https://go.oncehub.com/FrancineStephens) with her, so that the two of you can brainstorm the best method and walk through the steps for combining or embedding. 


### Before you Begin Building your Story Map

<span style="color: blue;">**View existing story maps to get ideas.**</span> Visit the [Story Maps Gallery](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/gallery/#s=0) to see some wonderful examples of story maps. Filter and search the gallery using the options on the left-hand side-bar to see how authors like you have created stories that may well be similar to the one you want to tell. Filter based on app type or topic or both. Explore. Get a sense of what the viewing experience looks like in the different templates and what makes a good story. Feel free to borrow approaches that you think work well, or come up with your own!  


<span style="color: blue;">**Select a template that works well for the story that you want to tell.**</span> From exploring the Story Maps Gallery, you may already have a good idea of which app template will work best for you. Using the links for the templates listed above, spend some time comparing the templates, the layout options they offer, and the different components they let you incorporate in your story. If you feel uncertain about selecting a template, there is a wizard on the [Apps page](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/) with an **"Ask the Pros"** feature in the Create Story function that can guide you to the best app template for your story.

<span style="color: blue;">**Plan and organize your story.**</span> Before you start putting your story map together online, you should first sketch it out *offline*. Outline what each story map “slide” will present. Figure out which visuals make the most sense. Sketch out which features of your template work best with your story’s narrative and flow. Below is a list of resources that you can use to plan your story map. 

* [Create a storyboard & content inventory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihe1agEV5e4CkoKvjKSptvXMSG11bXXA/view?usp=sharing) - Use the linked template or sketch an outline on your own. 
* [Review ESRI's planning document](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-storymaps/sharing-collaboration/planning-and-outlining-your-story-map-how-to-set-yourself-up-for-success/) - The blog contains an illustrated guide for planning your story.
* [Review the nine tips for effective digital storytelling](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/429bc4eed5f145109e603c9711a33407) - The tips are displayed in an ESRI Story Map.


If you have any questions or just want to bounce ideas off of someone, please do not hesitate to drop by Professor Stuart's or Francine's office hours. We are both happy to help you brainstorm and lay out some plans for your story map.
